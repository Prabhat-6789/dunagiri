                Nestled amidst the Dunagiri Mountains in the serene beauty of Uttarakhand, 
                Dunagiri Retreat stands as a beacon for spiritual seekers. Founded in 2005, 
                this eco-spiritual sanctuary is not just a yoga retreat but a profound journey 
                into self-discovery. Revered for its proximity to the legendary Mahavatar Babaji's
                 Cave and the sacred site of Dunagiri Temple, our retreat is a gateway to the transformative 
                 teachings of Kriya Yoga as expounded by Mahavatar Babaji and elucidated in Paramahansa Yogananda's '
                 Autobiography of a Yogi'.
                <br/>
                    At Dunagiri, spirituality and sustainability merge seamlessly. 
                    Our eco-friendly accommodations and organic gardens are set against a 
                    backdrop of the Himalayan splendor, offering a tranquil space for meditation 
                    retreats and a deep connection with nature. Immerse yourself in the 
                    spiritual essence of the holy river and the divine energy of Devi temples nearby.
